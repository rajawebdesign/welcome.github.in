India (Hindi: Bhārat), officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),</br>
[20] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, </br>
the second-most populous country, and the most populous democracy in the world.</br>
Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest,</br>
and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[e]</br>
China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east.</br>
In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives;</br>
its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.</p>

Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.</br>
[21] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers,</br>
 has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.</br>
 [22] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago,</br>
 evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[23] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit,</br>
 an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording</br>
 the dawning of Hinduism in India.[24] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern regions.[25] By 400 BCE,</p>
 
 stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[26] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social </br>
 rders unlinked to heredity.[27] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.</br>
 [28] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[29] but also marked by the declining status of women,</br>
 [30] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.</br>
 [f][31] In south India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of southeast Asia.[32]</p>

In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's southern and western coasts.</br>
[33] Armed invasions from Central Asia intermittently overran India's plains,[34] eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate,</br>
and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[35] In the 15th century,</br>
the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[36] In the Punjab,</p>

Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[37] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative </br>
[38] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[g][39] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed,</br>
turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[40] British Crown rule began in 1858.</br>
The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[41] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education,</br>
modernity and the public life took root.[42] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged,</br>
[43] which was noted for nonviolent resistance and led India to its independence in 1947.</p>

India is a secular federal republic governed in a democratic parliamentary system.</br>
It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society.</br>
India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1,211 million in 2011.</br>
[44] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%.</br>
From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[45] India has become a fast-growing major economy, a hub for information technology services,</br>
with an expanding middle class.[46] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies,</br>
music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.</p>
</p>
[47] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.</br>
[48] India is a nuclear weapons state, which ranks high in military expenditure.</br>
 It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.</br>
 [49] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[50] and rising levels of air pollution.</br>
 [51] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[52] Its forest cover comprises 21.4% of its area.[53] India's wildlife,</br>
 which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[54] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats. </br>
